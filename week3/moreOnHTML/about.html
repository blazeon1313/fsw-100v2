        <h1>My About Page</h1>
        <p>I was a Firefighter for 16 years. Fighting fires was a passion of mine. 
            There is nothing to compare to <strong>102ft</strong> flames.</p>
        <p>I fought fires all over the US from rolling hills to steep mountains. </p>
        <p>Moving on from fire was a very hard transition. I hit a very low spot in life. 
            I even tried to commit suicide 3 times during my low.</p>
        <p>I have been diagnosed with chronic suicidal tendencies and have an excellent 
            group that I do call on when I start the spiral effect. My support group is not 
            small and they know if I am calling it is to check in or to get my mind going back 
            straight.</p>
